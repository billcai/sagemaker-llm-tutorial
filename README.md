# SageMaker LLM Tutorial

## Outline

The tutorial consists of:

1. Launching and using LLMs on SageMaker Jumpstart ([see tutorial here](./jumpstart.md))
2. Deploying models from HuggingFace Model Hub to SageMaker ([see tutorial here](./notebooks/huggingface_deployment_new.ipynb))
3. Model acceleration and quantized models
    1. Using DeepSpeed and HuggingFace Accelerate to improve inference performance ([see tutorial here]((./notebooks/llm_deployment_extended.ipynb)))
4. LLM Fine-tuning and Applications
    1. Using Langchain for composability and building apps ([see tutorial here](./notebooks/sagemaker-jumpstart-langchain.ipynb))

## Additional: Zero Shot Text and Image Tutorials

1. Zero-shot text classification ([see tutorial here](./zero_shot_tutorial/zero_shot_text_classification.ipynb))
2. Zero-shot object detection ([see tutorial here](./zero_shot_tutorial/zero_shot_image_object.ipynb))
